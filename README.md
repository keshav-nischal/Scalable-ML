# Scalable ML

A growing, hands-on repository focused on learning, building and understanding **machine learning systems that scale from experimentation to production**.

This repo serves as a practical workspace where I implement concepts while studying ML/DS and ML infrastructure—turning theory into code.
The goal is to incrementally develop components that reflect real-world ML workflows: data processing, training, evaluation, and serving.

## Current Status

🚧 Early stage — actively being built and refined.

## Focus Areas (will expand over time)

* ML/DL fundamentals development
* Deployment and MLOps fundamentals
* Performance and scalability considerations
* ML Workflows

... other sections coming soon!

This is a long-term, iterative project documenting my progression toward **production-grade ML engineering and scalable AI systems**.
