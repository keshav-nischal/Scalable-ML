# Scalable ML

A growing, hands-on repository focused on learning, building and understanding **machine learning systems that scale from experimentation to production**.

This repo serves as a practical workspace where I implement concepts while studying ML/DS and ML infrastructure—turning theory into modular, reproducible, and performance-aware code.
Instead of isolated notebooks, the goal is to incrementally develop components that reflect real-world ML workflows: data processing, training, evaluation, and serving.

## Current Status

🚧 Early stage — actively being built and refined.

## Focus Areas (will expand over time)

* Efficient training workflows
* ML/DL fundamentals development
* Performance and scalability considerations
* Deployment and MLOps fundamentals

## Approach

* Learn → implement → refactor → scale
* Keep code modular and production-minded
* Track measurable improvements over time

## Roadmap

This repository will continuously evolve with:

* New implementations & Research work
* Benchmarks and comparisons
* Better abstractions
* End-to-end ML workflows

This is a long-term, iterative project documenting my progression toward **production-grade ML engineering and scalable AI systems**.
